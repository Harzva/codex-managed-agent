## Loop Type

- type: analysis

## What Changed

- Recorded that the unchanged hardening-first mailbox handoff remains stable until the resolver slice is executed.
- Kept the next step fixed on the same execution slice.

## Plan

- Active plan: `.claude/plans/ACTIVE_PLAN.md`
- Current milestone: follow-on track — `task-plans/codex-team-mailbox-loop-task-plan.md`
- Bounded target: preserve the stable unchanged handoff without turning it into a new plan branch

## Review Window

- reviewed loops: `evolution-2026-04-16-mailbox-unchanged-handoff-restatement.md` and `evolution-2026-04-16-mailbox-unchanged-handoff-bookkeeping.md`
- status: analysis complete; next slice should stay hardening-first

## Analysis Checks

- legacy thread lifecycle safety: unchanged. No new lifecycle mutation risk appeared in the reviewed window.
- board/tab semantic safety: unchanged. No new routing or dashboard regression appeared in the reviewed window.
- loop-only cadence impact: unchanged and aligned at 1 minute.
- task-plan/code alignment: stable. The only remaining actionable work is still the Task 6 resolver pair plus syntax check.
- next slice decision: yes, hardening-first. The next execution slice should still add one shared live-thread resolver before mailbox writes.

## Next Handoff

- Follow `.claude/plans/ACTIVE_PLAN.md`
- Execute one hardening-first slice: add one shared live-thread resolver from `panel.lastPayload.dashboard.threads`, close the remaining stale-thread validation pair, and run the Task 6 syntax check after the code change
